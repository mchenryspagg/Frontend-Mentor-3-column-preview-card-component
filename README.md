### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have learnt how to build a responsive site for different screen sizes. I have also learnt how to use the flexbox layout, use google fonts for styling and also build a custom website with HTML and CSS.


### Continued development

I intend to continue building webpages with CSS flexbox, and to also work on other projects that would test my understanding of CSS grid layout, box layout and Javascript until i am confident enough in my ability to start applying for internships and junior developer roles

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - This helped me to fully understand the application of CSS flexbox after using so many materials and websites to attempt learning it. I really liked its lessons and will use it going forward to sharpen my knowledge on flexbox.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/) - This is an amazing website to learn web design. I learnt quite a lot from freecodecamp and i am yet to complete the certificate course which i will keep in mind.
